# Session Summary

This document summarizes the work completed during our session for the 'allbikes' project.

## 1. Project Scaffolding and Setup

- **Django Project:** A new Django project named 'allbikes' was created.
- **Applications:** Three initial Django apps were generated: `service`, `inventory`, and `management`.
- **`.gitignore`:** A standard `.gitignore` file for Django projects was created.
- **Virtual Environment:** A Python virtual environment (`venv`) was set up for the project.

## 2. Git and Frontend Development

- **GitHub Integration:** A local Git repository was initialized and the new project was pushed to a new remote repository on GitHub.
- **Frontend Scaffolding:** A new frontend application was created in the `allbikes/frontend/` directory using Vite with the React and TypeScript template. This was done to mirror the setup of the `futurereminder` project.
- **Styling and UI:** The frontend was configured with Tailwind CSS and `shadcn/ui`.
- **Basic Layout:** A basic application layout was created, including a `NavBar` and a `Footer` component, with routing handled by `react-router-dom`.
- **Dependency Fix:** Resolved a runtime error by installing the missing `react-router-dom` package.

## 3. Data Migration and API Integration

- **API Service Class:** A `MechanicsDeskService` class was created to handle communication with the external MechanicDesk API for creating bookings. The API token was configured to be loaded from environment variables.
- **Data Export (from `SCOOTER_SHOP`):**
  - A management command (`export_inventory_data`) was created in the old `SCOOTER_SHOP` project.
  - This command uses `dumpdata` to export the `Motorcycle`, `MotorcycleImage`, and `MotorcycleCondition` models to JSON files.
- **Data Transformation (in `allbikes`):**
  - A management command (`clean_motorcycle_json`) was created to clean the exported JSON data, removing obsolete fields and renaming `brand` to `make` to match the new `allbikes` model schema.
  - A management command (`download_scootershop_images`) was created to download all motorcycle images from the live website, using the image paths found in the exported JSON files.
  - A management command (`organize_images`) was created to copy the downloaded images into a structured directory hierarchy within the frontend assets folder (`frontend/src/assets/motorcycle_images/make-model-year/`).

## 4. Django App and Model Configuration

- **Model Imports:** The `__init__.py` files within the `models` directories for the `inventory`, `service`, and `data_management` apps were populated with the necessary imports to make the models easily accessible.
- **Configuration Errors:**
  - Resolved a `ModuleNotFoundError` for Django by adding `Django` to the `requirements.txt` file and providing guidance on how to correctly install packages into the virtual environment.
  - Fixed an `ImproperlyConfigured` error by correcting the `name` attribute in the `AppConfig` for the `data_management` app and registering the apps in `settings.py`.
