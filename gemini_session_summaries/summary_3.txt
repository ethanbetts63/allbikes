This session addressed two primary objectives: resolving a critical bug in the flower plan creation process and establishing the foundation for a new user dashboard.

The session began by diagnosing a `400 Bad Request` error that prevented users from creating flower plans. The investigation revealed a field name inconsistency between the frontend and backend for the 'budget' and 'years' of a plan. The backend serializer's attempt to map these fields was causing validation failures.

To fix this, the field names were standardized across the entire application:
- On the backend, the `FlowerPlan` model was modified, and the corresponding serializer and views were updated to use the consistent names. This change required a database migration.
- On the frontend, all related components and API calls were updated to send data using the newly aligned field names, eliminating the error.

With the bug resolved, the project shifted to creating a user account area:
- The main navigation bar was enhanced to display a conditional "Account" button for authenticated users, which directs them to a new dashboard.
- A new dashboard section was created, featuring a central page that links to "Account Management" and the newly created "Flower Plan Management" page.
- The application's routing was reconfigured to support this new, organized dashboard structure.
