Online Service Booking Terms
TERMS OF BOOKING
Introduction
This business and your authorised dealer, (“Dealer”) (collectively, “We” “Our” or “Us”) offer you the option to book and pay for a service on your Vehicle (including both scheduled and non-scheduled services) online (“Booking”). Our online service booking system lets you book and pay for a service for your Vehicle with your nominated Dealer in your own space and time (“Booking System”). Placing and paying for a Booking via the Booking System is only available to Australian residents aged 18 years and over. By using the Booking System, you agree to the following terms. Before finalising your Booking via the Booking System, you must carefully read and ACCEPT these Terms and the This business Privacy Policy.
By clicking ‘CONFIRM’ and submitting payment of the Fees for your Booking, you become bound by these Terms. If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms, do not click ‘CONFIRM’ and submit payment of the Fees.
Certain laws such as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and any applicable state-based consumer legislation (“Consumer Laws”) are in place for your protection. They are designed to ensure Our services are provided with due care and skill and are fit for purpose. The Terms do not alter any protection given to you under Consumer Laws.
These Terms form part of the agreement between you and the Dealer for provision of a Booking.
