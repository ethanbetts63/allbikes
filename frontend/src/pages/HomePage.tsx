      "question": "What types of motorcycles and scooters do you service?",
      "answer": "We service all motorcycles and most scooters. For scooters, we specialise in Italian brands and mid to upper-end Asian brands. Some brands are excluded due to parts availability and build quality concerns, allowing us to maintain reliable, long-lasting repairs. Full details are listed on our service page."

      "question": "What areas of Perth do you service?",
      "answer": `Our workshop is based in Dianella at ${siteSettings.street_address || '{address}'}. If you are looking for "motorcycle mechanics near me" or "scooter mechanics near me", Allbikes & Scooters frequently services the areas of Dianella, Morley, Fremantle, Yokine, CBD, Menora, Cottesloe, Mount Lawley, North Perth, Northbridge, Inglewood and many other Perth suburbs. If you are more distant, or are unable to move your bike, we work closely with and can recommend Perth Motorcycle and Scooter Movers. More information is available on our service page.`
